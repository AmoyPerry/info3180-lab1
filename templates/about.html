 <h1>Amoy K. Perry</h1>
 <p> I am the second born to a pair of girl twins. I am in my final year of pursuing a degree in Computer Science. Initially, I wanted to do a double major, but I failed a course, my first and definitely last, and as such Electronics existence, on my soon to gain degree, was destroyed. Lastly, I am a Christian and I am appreciative of every opportunity the Lord has blessed me with. </p>
